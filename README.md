## Features Implement in This Assignment 
------------------------------------------

Following is the step by step description of the problem statement :
Step 1 – Display following UI components.
(A) – an empty div.
(B) – 5 circles each of unique colours. The colour generation method should randomly pick
and assign one of the five colours to the circles. However, a colour cannot be duplicated.

Step 2 – A user can enter a number in the text box and click shoot button. This would move
the corresponding circle into the empty div. In the figure below, user entered 2 and clicked
shoot button, which moved the 2nd circle into the empty div.

Step 3 – The circles get reorganised. Therefore the purple circle which was at 3rd position
now moves up and occupies 2rd position.

Step 4 - The user can shoot multiple circles and the corresponding circles would move in to
the empty div. In the below figure, the user again entered 3 and corresponding circle got
moved into the empty div.

Step 5 – The user can get back the circles that were shot by clicking the corresponding
circles residing in the empty div. Example the user clicked yellow circle which was inside the
empty div and the yellow came back to its original position (that is second position). Please
note that this is important consideration in the problem.

Step 6 – Continuing with step 5, clicking the blue circle restores it’s original position that is 4th.
